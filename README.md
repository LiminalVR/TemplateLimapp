# Limapp Template
This is a Unity Project template with the Liminal SDK installed.

## Requirements
- Unity 2019.1.10f1
- [Git setup correctly in your environment path](https://github.com/LiminalVR/LiminalSdk-UnityPackage/blob/develop/README.md#setup-git)

## Project Settings
- Android ready
- Oculus VR Ready
- Graphics & Quality settings to Liminal's standards

## Notes
The first time you open the project may take up to 5 minutes, Unity will give you a window "Unity Package Manager - Resolving packages...", this is okay and will take some time.
